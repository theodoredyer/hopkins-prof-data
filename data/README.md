#### Some Notes about the Data
- ICR = Instructor Composite Rating, constructed by student response means to the following fields: 0-5 ratings for 'Demonstrated relationships between theory and practice', 'gave understandable presentations', 'used appropriate examples to clarify points', 'provided useful responses to questions', 'responded to inquiries in a timely manner'. **Should be some score x/25. A high score in this category reflects the professor's ability to provide and explain material and help 1-on-1**
- GCR = Grading Composite Ranking, constructed by student response means to the following fields: 0-5 ratings for 'Graded my performance fairly', 'Provided useful feedback on assignments', 'Provided useful feedback on assessments' **Should be some score x/15. A high score in this category reflects fair grading for the course**
- CCR = Course Composite Ranking, constructed by student response means to the following fields: 0-5 ratings for 'The required materials contributed to my learning', 'course assessments measured what I learned in the course', 'course content was relevant to my career' **Should be some score x/15. A high score in this category reflects the content being relavant**
- CR = Challenge Ranking, constructed by student response means to the following fields: 0-5 ratings for 'The course content challenged me' This data may not be that useful as when taking a survey I'm sure students automatically gravitated towards higher rankings due to the other questions surrounding this one, but could be useful.
