#### The goal of this project is to build a tool to help me analyze data from Hopkins professor student evaluations in order to select the best professor for upcoming classes by comparing them to eachother in a set of criteria that I have not yet determined. 

### Goals
- 1 Scrape data from https://ep.jhu.edu/course-evaluation-results-public-reports
- 2 Compile data into a spreadsheet
- 3 Use python and data analytics tools to break this data up into separate csv files.
- 4 Determine how to structure my csv files, all professors for a class in a specific file? or all professors separated? etc
